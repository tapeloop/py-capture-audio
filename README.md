### Startup

```
python py-capture-audio

```space-bar``` This both starts and stops the recording process. All files will be located in the <<blah>> folder unless an alternative is specified at started 
## What it will do
Py-Capture-Audio is an audio scrapbook, designed to run in the background and be used easily whenever something interesting presents itself for recording

## The Name

This comes from the band Pye Corner Audio and does not imply any kind of endorsement or usage. I genuinely used to believe that Rebirth and Reason were made by Propellerheads the band so I dont want to cause any confusion
